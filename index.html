            <h3>Growing up</h3>
            <p> My father was in the Navy. Luckily, while growing up I didnt have to move as often as other kids whose parents were in the military. I was born in 
                the Philippines and moved to San Diego at the age of two. My dad served 20 years in the US Navy and when he retired he wanted to go "home". That is 
                when we moved to Mascoutah which is not far from where he grew up. </p>

            <h3>HighSchool</h3>

            <p> I can honestly say when I first moved to Mascoutah I was not very happy. I went from beaches to corn fields and had never seen snow in my life. 
                I wasn't used to experiencing all the seasons and of course I missed all of my friends. The school and town was so small compared to what I was used to.
                Despite the school being so small it was well known for being a very good school district. Sometime after I graduated the school waws completely rebuilt.
                I now have a son that attends Mascoutah HighSchool.</p>

            <h3>My Son</h3>

            <p> I have a son named Angelo who is a freshman in highschool. He was first born in Mascoutah but we moved shortly after. Growing up he had went to a couple of 
                different schools and we finally moved back when Angelo began middle school.
                Angelo loves to play baseball and is currently doing baseball warm ups at the highschool while waiting for tryouts for the school team.
                Watching my son and his team play ball this year was probably one of the only things that kept me sane during all of these COVID lockdowns.  </p>

            <h3>My daughter</h3>
            <img src="images/leilani.jpg" alt="Leilani on her birthday" width="200" height="250">
            <p> I have a daughter name Leilani that is 3 who was also born in Mascoutah. Unfortunately due to COVID we chose to not let her attend school this year. 
                She does enjoy the parks in our area, quality time with family, and getting to watch her big brother play baseball. Needless to say, she is one of her 
                "Bubbas" biggest fan. He tries to coach and train her as well. So far she knows how to pitch but can still use a lot of practice catching.</p>

            <h3>Where We Met</h3>
            <img src="images/wes_n_i.jpg" alt="Wes and I at the Xmas party" width="200" height="250">
            <p> My husband and I met my freshman year of highschool and eventually started dating almost 20 years later. 
                I was actually best friends with his sister in school so was already pretty close to his family before we even started dating. Throughout life we both had moved
                away from Mascoutah. Eventually, we both moved backed, reconnected, and married. He is a great husband and father. He is also very hardworking and full of
                knowledge. He is also a great handy man around the house. The only thing he needs to work on is attending to spiders and bugs with more urgency :)  </p>
